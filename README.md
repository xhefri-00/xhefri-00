# About Me 🚀

- 🤓 I'm a passionate *Software Engineer* skilled in both front- and backend development. Why settle for one when you can have both? 😁
- ⚡️ I love creating projects that are helpful, enjoyable, and make life easier, taking ideas from 0 to 100. 🌞
- ⛅️ After graduating, I followed my passion and transitioned into tech, completing a 12-month bootcamp at [Masterschool](https://www.masterschool.com/) that equipped me with essential technical and soft skills for Software Engineering.
